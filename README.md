## Henry Gordon

I have a very strong interest in pursuing a career in software development and believe I have the necessary credentials to succeed in this field…intelligent, resourceful, hardworking, engaging with an impeccable academic record, I have much to offer.
Having graduated from Durham University with a 2:1 honours Mechanical Engineering Degree (MEng), I very quickly realised that Software Development was my preferred field and successfully completed the 12 week long course at Makers Academy to become a developer.

My aim now? To consolidate my specialism by adding value to an organisation, in an industry that I find both exciting and challenging.

## Skills

#### Software Craftsmanship

Educated to the level of junior developer, with a passion for clean refactored code that is fully test driven.

- Makers Academy software course.
- OOP, TDD, MVC, agile

#### Problem Solving

- Essar Oil - Primary objective was to redesign the rubber lined pipework in the demineralized water plant. Successful completion of the task required in depth knowledge of the workings of the refinery, most of which could only be acquired through communication with others.

- Durham University - I undertook numerous engineering projects that had to be solved efficiently and innovatively. These ranged from partnering with Black & Decker to develop a "streak free" window cleaner, to designing an affordable boat suitable for use in the Mekong Delta - a project in which my team and I achieved first place in an inter course competition.

#### Teamwork

An effective team player has the ability to inspire and encourage other members to perform to their full potential. I have honed my teamwork skills through numerous successful group projects both at University and Makers Academy.

#### Leadership

I have demonstrated my exceptional leadership skills in a range of different scenarios:

- Bicycle touring - Organisation of two bicycle tours, which included persuading people to partake, maintaining team moral, route management and decision making whilst on the road.

- Team building - After a hard days work on a given project, to maintain morale and ensure a happy, cohesive team I am always ready to go the extra mile and lead members of the team to the pub!
